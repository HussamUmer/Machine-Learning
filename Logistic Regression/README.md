Welcome to the **Logistic Regression** section of this beginner-friendly ML repository!

Logistic Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms used for **classification** — especially when the target is binary (like spam/ham, yes/no, or 0/1). Despite the name, it’s a **classification**, not regression, algorithm.

## 📌 What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression models the **probability** that a data point belongs to a particular class.  
It’s easy to understand and implement — making it perfect for beginners tackling binary classification tasks.

We use `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` throughout these projects.
