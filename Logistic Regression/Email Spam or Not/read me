📩 Email Spam Classifier (Logistic Regression)

Welcome! This is a simple but effective **email spam detection** project built using "Logistic Regression". 
The goal? To train a machine to tell whether a message is spam or not — because nobody likes to be tricked into 
clicking on "You’ve won $1,000,000!" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 What’s Inside?

This project walks through the full journey from raw text messages to a trained model that can classify them as
"spam" or "ham" (non-spam). It includes:

- 💬 "Text preprocessing" using Bag of Words
- 📊 "Exploratory Data Analysis" (visuals included)
- 🧠 "Model training" using logistic regression
- 🧪 "Evaluation metrics" (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- 🔐 Optional: Save the model and vectorizer for later use

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Model Performance

After training and testing, here’s how our model performed on unseen data:

- "Accuracy:" 97.76%
- "Precision (Spam):" 99%
- "Recall (Spam):" 84%
- "F1-Score (Spam):" 91%

Not bad, right? Especially considering the simplicity of the algorithm!

💡 Why Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a classic go-to for binary classification problems. It’s simple, interpretable, and 
surprisingly powerful, a great starting point before exploring more complex models like Naive Bayes or transformers.

📬 Final Thoughts
Spam detection is one of the OGs of machine learning problems, and for good reason — it's practical, relevant, and 
packed with NLP challenges. If you're just getting into classification or natural language processing, this is a 
perfect playground.
