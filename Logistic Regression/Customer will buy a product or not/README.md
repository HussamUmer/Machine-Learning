# 🛍️ Purchase Prediction Classifier (Logistic Regression)

Welcome! This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a person is likely to purchase
a product based on simple features like age, gender, and estimated salary. Think of it as a helpful
assistant for marketing teams deciding who to target with ads or promotions.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

This notebook takes you through the entire process of building a binary classifier from scratch using 
structured data. Here’s what’s covered:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior
🧹 Preprocessing: Label encoding, scaling, and cleaning
🧠 Model training using logistic regression
🧪 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
📈 Visualizations: From boxplots to decision boundaries
💾 Saving the model (and scaler!) for future use
🧠 Model Performance

After training and evaluating the model, here are the results:
Accuracy: 88.75%
Precision (Purchased): 91%
Recall (Purchased): 75%
F1-Score (Purchased): 82%

It's a solid performance for a lightweight model! It’s particularly strong at detecting users who 
don’t purchase, with room to improve on recall for purchasers — great as a baseline.
