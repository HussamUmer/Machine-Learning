Welcome to the **Linear Regression** section of this beginner-friendly machine learning repository!  
Linear Regression is one of the most intuitive algorithms used to predict **continuous values**.

Here, we've applied it to four real-world problems using Python, scikit-learn, and visualizations through Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## 🧠 What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression tries to model the relationship between input features and a numeric target variable by fitting the best possible line through the data.

We use `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` across all projects.
