# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on different features like area, neighborhood, overall quality, and more.

It’s part of my machine learning journey — learning by doing real-world projects on real data.

## 📂 What's Inside

- `house_prediction.ipynb` — the full notebook with code, explanations, and results  
- `train.csv` and `test.csv` — the dataset used for training and testing  
- `output/visualizations/` — saved charts that helped explore the data  
- `output/model.pkl` — trained regression model  
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies used in the notebook  
- `README.md` — you're reading it!

## 💡 Project Overview

This project uses the "Ames Housing dataset" (similar to the famous Kaggle House Prices competition).
The goal is to train a regression model that can estimate house sale prices using various numerical and categorical features.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and explored the data (EDA)
- Visualized patterns and correlations
- Built a "Linear Regression model using scikit-learn"
- Evaluated its performance using real metrics
- Saved the model and results for reuse

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Model Performance

After training, here's how well the model performed on the test set:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $13,460  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $20,956  
- R² Score: 0.9304

That means the model can explain over "93% of the variation" in house prices , 
not bad for a simple linear model!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🖼️ Visualizations

I created a few visual plots to better understand the data, such as:

- Distribution of Sale Prices
- Average House Price by Neighborhood**
- Correlation Heatmap

📁 You can find them in the [`output/visualizations/`](output/visualizations) folder.
