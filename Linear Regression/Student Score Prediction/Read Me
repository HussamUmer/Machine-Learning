🎓 Student Performance Prediction

Welcome to this machine learning project where we explore how different factors affect student academic performance ,
and try to "predict their exam scores" based on that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 What’s This About?

We used a dataset that includes student demographic details (like gender, ethnicity, parental education), 
as well as school-related factors like:
- Whether the student completed a test preparation course
- Lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
- Final scores in math, reading, and writing
The goal: "predict the average exam score" using linear regression.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Key Insights from the Data

- Students who completed the test prep course "scored noticeably higher"
- A standard lunch correlated with better writing and reading performance
- Parental education level showed "some influence" on scores, especially math 
- Gender differences were visible — but not always consistent across subjects

We used "colorful and clear visualizations" to highlight these relationships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠️ Model & Results

We trained a simple **Linear Regression** model and tested it on unseen data.
Final Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 10.49
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 13.40
- R² Score: 0.1622

This means our predictions are "roughly 10–13 points off" from actual scores, not bad, 
but there's definitely room to grow with more features or advanced models.

💼 Technologies Used

- Python 
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for data wrangling & visualization
- scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🤔 What Could Be Better?

- Adding more variables like study time, class participation, etc.
- Trying other models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning
