# 📘 Machine Learning Algorithms - Projects and Practice

Hi there! 👋  
This repository contains beginner-friendly machine learning projects, grouped by algorithms. Each folder includes real-world mini-projects using open datasets (mostly from Kaggle), with code, explanations, and results.

I built these to practice and understand how different ML algorithms work — from predicting house prices to detecting spam messages. Hope it helps you too! 😊
