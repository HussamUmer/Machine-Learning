Welcome to the **Decision Tree** section of this beginner-friendly machine learning repository!  
Decision Trees are one of the most intuitive models — they mimic how humans make decisions by asking a series of questions.

---

## 📌 What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like structure that recursively splits data into branches based on feature values.  
At each step, it selects the most informative feature using metrics like **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy**, until it reaches a decision.

Great for:
- **Classification** tasks (like predicting churn or loan approval)
- Easy **interpretability**
- No need for feature scaling
