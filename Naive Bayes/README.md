Welcome to the **Naive Bayes** section of this beginner-friendly machine learning repository!  
Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classifier** that works especially well for **text classification** problems.

## 📌 What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a family of classifiers based on **Bayes' Theorem** with a strong (naive) assumption of independence between features.  
Despite its simplicity, it's widely used in spam filters, sentiment analysis, and document classification.
