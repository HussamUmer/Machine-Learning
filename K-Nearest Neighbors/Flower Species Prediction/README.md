# 🌸 Iris Species Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Welcome! This project is all about using a simple yet powerful algorithm — K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to classify
one of nature's most iconic flowers: the iris. With just four features (like petal length and sepal width), we’ll 
teach a machine to identify which species an iris belongs to.

## 🧠 What is this project about?

We’re working with the classic Iris dataset — a staple in machine learning. Our goal is to build a model that can 
classify iris flowers into one of the three species:
--Setosa
--Versicolor
--Virginica

And we’ve used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to make this classification based on how similar one flower
is to others.

## 🧪 What did we do?

Here’s the step-by-step journey:

📊 Explored the dataset with beautiful and colorful EDA plots
✂️ Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) 
🤖 Trained a KNN classifier on the training set 
✅ Tested the model on the test data and evaluated its performance 
💾 Saved the trained model so we can use it again later

## 📈 Model Performance

The results? Honestly, they couldn’t be better:
✅ Accuracy: 100%

Our model nailed every prediction! Of course, this is a well-behaved dataset — but still, it shows that KNN can perform
really well on clearly separable data.

## 💾 How to Reuse the Model

We’ve also saved the model so it can be reused without retraining.
