Welcome to the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** section of this beginner-friendly ML repo!  
SVM is a **supervised learning algorithm** known for its ability to find the optimal boundary between classes, making it powerful for both **linear and non-linear classification tasks**.

---

## 📌 What is SVM?

SVM finds the **best separating line (or hyperplane)** that maximizes the margin between different classes.  
It’s ideal for **high-dimensional data** and works great with **kernel tricks** to handle non-linearly separable datasets.
