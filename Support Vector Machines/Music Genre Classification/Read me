🎵 Music Genre Classification using SVM
========================================
A baseline ML approach on the GTZAN Dataset with real-world challenges and reflections

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Project Overview
====================
This project explores music genre classification using traditional machine learning techniques. We use the
GTZAN Music Genre Dataset and apply a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on MFCC features extracted 
from audio files.

While deep learning is the go-to for modern audio tasks, this project intentionally takes a step back to 
evaluate how far classic ML can go in a genre classification task—and what its limits are.

📂 Dataset: GTZAN Music Genre Dataset
📁 10 Genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock
🎧 1,000 audio clips: 100 per genre
⏱️ Each clip: 30 seconds
📦 Format: .wav

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠️ What This Project Does
===========================
1. Extracts MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) from each audio file
2. Builds a Support Vector Machine classifier
3. Evaluates the model using accuracy and a classification report
4. Reflects on performance challenges and paths forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧪 Model Evaluation
====================
✅ Accuracy Score: 0.6300

⚠️ Performance varies significantly across genres. Some genres (like metal and hiphop) are classified well,
while others like rock are much harder to separate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚠️ Challenges Faced
=====================
📉 Accuracy Ceiling
---------------------
63% accuracy is decent for a baseline SVM on raw MFCCs but not competitive with state-of-the-art.
This task is inherently complex, and classic ML struggles to separate overlapping acoustic patterns.

🎼 Dataset Limitations
------------------------
Genre overlap: Some clips have ambiguous or mixed genre traits.
Mislabeling & repetition: GTZAN has known issues with repeated tracks and mislabels.
Noisy clips: Some samples contain artifacts or poor recording quality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Model Limitations
=====================
1. SVMs are linear or kernel-based and don’t capture time-dependent patterns well.
2. MFCCs reduce audio to a simplified representation, losing temporal richness.
3. No use of spectrograms or CNNs, which tend to perform better in music/audio tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 Future Improvements
=======================
Here’s how this project could evolve:

🔁 Use spectrograms + Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
🎵 Include tempo, chroma, spectral contrast features for richer input
🤖 Try deep learning architectures like CNN-LSTM or transformers
📊 Perform data augmentation to improve robustness
🧽 Clean the dataset: filter duplicates, validate labels

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Why Share a 63% Model?
==========================
Because research is about the process, not just the number.
This project shows:

1. How far you can go with classic ML
2. The limitations of traditional approaches
3. A thoughtful analysis of model and data quality

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Takeaway
============
Genre classification is tough — especially with messy real-world data and classic models.
But building this from the ground up gives us a strong foundation to experiment, learn, and grow.

📌 This project is a baseline — not the finish line.
